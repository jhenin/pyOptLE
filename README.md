# pyOptLE

High-performance python implementation of [optLE](https://github.com/physix-repo/optLE) by the lab of Fabio Pietrucci 
- Much more limited in scope: only fits overdamped Langevin equations using a first-order propagator.
- Adds the debiasing feature (removing a time-dependent biasing force)

In the process of being replaced by [FOLIE](https://github.com/langevinmodel/folie)
